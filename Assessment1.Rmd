# Section 2: Research Question {.tabset .tabset-fade}

This analysis investigates global population trends from 1950 to the present day. The primary objective is to identify and compare global population patterns, with particular focus on the world's most populous nations, through an examination of both total population changes and growth rates over this period.

# Section 3: Data Set Introduction {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The population dataset was retrieved from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth), which provides historical population statistics. This dataset allows for the examination of long-term demographic changes and growth patterns across countries since 1950.

The country variable represents the name of each nation or region as a character string. The year variable is a numeric value ranging from 1950 to the present, indicating the observation year. The population variable measures the total population count for each country as a numeric value, while the growth_rate variable calculates the annual population growth rate as a percentage change from the previous year. The pop_index variable shows the population index relative to the base year of 1950, with a value of 100 assigned to that year to indicate relative growth over time.

```{r load-data}
# Read and prepare the data
population_data <- read_csv("~/Desktop/ETO5513/Data/population_subset.csv") %>%
  rename(
    country = Entity,
    year = Year,
    population = `Population - Sex: all - Age: all - Variant: estimates`
  ) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(
    growth_rate = (population - lag(population)) / lag(population) * 100,
    pop_index = (population / first(population)) * 100
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(country, year, population, growth_rate, pop_index)

# Display variable information
tibble(
  Variable = names(population_data),
  Description = c(
    "Country or region name",
    "Year of observation",
    "Total population count",
    "Annual growth rate (%)",
    "Population index (base year = 100)"
  )
) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Variables in the Analysis Dataset",
    align = c("l", "l")
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
    full_width = FALSE
  )
```

# Section 4: Data Set Description {.tabset .tabset-fade}

```{r data-description}
# Calculate dimensions
n_vars <- ncol(population_data)
n_obs <- nrow(population_data)
```

Our dataset contains `r n_vars` variables and `r n_obs` observations, providing a complete overview of population trends from 1950 to present.

# Section 5: Data Summary {.tabset .tabset-fade}

```{r summary-stats}
# Create decade summary for all countries
decade_stats <- population_data
decade_stats$decade <- floor(decade_stats$year/10) * 10

# Calculate summary statistics by decade
summary_stats <- aggregate(
  cbind(population, growth_rate) ~ decade, 
  data = decade_stats,
  FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
)

# Sort by decade
summary_stats <- summary_stats[order(summary_stats$decade),]

# Format population with commas but keep decades without commas
kable(summary_stats,
      caption = "Global Mean Population and Growth Rate Statistics by Decade (1950-Present)",
      col.names = c("Decade", "Mean Population", "Mean Growth Rate (%)"),
      digits = c(0, 0, 2),
      row.names = FALSE,     
      align = c('c', 'r', 'r')) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2c3e50") %>%
  row_spec(seq(1, nrow(summary_stats)), background = "#f8f9fa") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

The data summary indicates that global population has experienced a steady **upward** trend, with the biggest increases occurring between 2000-2020. Additionally, population growth rates were highest in the 1960s and 1970s but have slowed down in more recent decades, suggesting a more stable and sustainable growth pattern.

# Section 6: Visualizations {.tabset .tabset-fade}

```{r theme-setup}
# Custom theme for consistent plot styling
theme_custom <- theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = "gray50"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=1),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")
)
```

### Global Population Trend

```{r world-population}
# Create world population plot
world_data <- subset(population_data, country == "World")

ggplot(data = world_data, aes(x = year, y = population/1e9)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2E86C1", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  labs(
    title = "World Population Growth (1950-Present)",
    subtitle = "Total Population in Billions",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population (Billions)"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2020, by = 10)) +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1)) +
  theme_custom
```
*Key observations from the visualizations:*

* *The world's total population has shown consistent upward growth and has more than tripled since 1950*

* *The growth rate appears to be accelerating, showing a steeper increase in recent decades*
  
### Additional Population Analysis

```{r top5_countries}
# Top 5 countries data
no_world_data <- subset(population_data, country != "World")
top5_max_pop <- aggregate(population ~ country, data = no_world_data, max)
top5_data <- head(top5_max_pop[order(-top5_max_pop$population), "country"], 5)

# Filter data
plot_data <- subset(population_data, country %in% top5_data)

# Create line graph
ggplot(data = plot_data, aes(x = year, y = population/1e6, color = country)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  labs(
    title = "Population Trends in Five Most Populous Countries",
    subtitle = "1950-Present",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population (Millions)",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950, 2020, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_custom
```
The line graph shows the population growth in the five most populous countries from 1950 to the present. China and India appear the most populous, with both nations exceeding 1 billion people and displaying steep upward growth patterns. However, China's growth has begun to plateau in the recent decades. The United States, Indonesia, and Nigeria have trend lines at much lower levels and maintaining steady growth rates over time.

```{r top10_summary}
# Top 10 countries data
top10_stats <- subset(population_data, country != "World") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_population = mean(population),
    avg_growth = mean(growth_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_population)) %>%
  head(10)

# Display kable table
kable(top10_stats,
      caption = "Average Population and Growth Rate of Top 10 Countries (1950-Present)",
      col.names = c("Country", "Average Population", "Average Growth Rate (%)"),
      digits = c(0, 0, 2),
      row.names = FALSE,     
      align = c('l', 'r', 'r'),
      format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "bordered"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2c3e50") %>%
  row_spec(seq(1, nrow(top10_stats)), background = "#f8f9fa") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

This table shows growth rates of the top 10 largest countries over our defined period. China and India have the highest population averages but they've grown at different speeds over time. On the other hand Pakistan and Ethiopia have recorded the highest average growth rates. The table helps us picture the enormity of some countries and how their populations have grown differently over time.
  
# Section 7: Conclusion {.tabset .tabset-fade}

This analysis of global population trends from 1950 to the present provides important insights. The data reveals consistent worldwide growth with the most significant increases between 2000-2020. However, growth rates have slowed in recent decades suggesting more sustainable patterns. Examining the world's most populous countries shows striking differences. China and India lead in total population, with steep upward growth, whereas China's growth has plateaued while India's remains steady. These differences are significant as they can help predict future changes and development needs. This study offers insights to provide strategies and policies to support the growth of the global population.
